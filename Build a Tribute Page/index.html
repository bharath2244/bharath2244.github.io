        <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Visvesvaraya" target="_blank">Visvesvaraya</a> took a job as an assistant engineer with the Public Works
        Department of Bombay, and later was invited to join the Indian Irrigation Commission. He implemented an intricate system of irrigation in the Deccan Plateau,
        and designed and patented a system of automatic weir water floodgates that were first installed in 1903 at Khadakvasla Reservoir near Pune. These gates raised
        the storage level in the reservoir to the highest level likely to be attained without causing damage to the dam. Based on the success of these gates, the same
        system was installed at Tigra Dam in Gwalior and Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) Dam in Mandya/Mysore, Karnataka. In 1906â€“1907, the Government of India sent him to
        Aden to study water supply and drainage systems. The project prepared by him was implemented in Aden successfully.[7] Visvesvaraya achieved celebrity status
        when he designed a flood protection system for city of Hyderabad. He was instrumental in developing a system to protect Visakhapatnam port from sea erosion.
        [8] This dam created the biggest reservoir in Asia when it was built.[9] Visvesvaraya gave his technical advice for the location of Mokama Bridge over Ganga
        in Bihar. At the time, he was over 90 years old,[10][11] and was called the "Father of Modern Mysore State".

        During his service with the Government of Mysore state, he was responsible (under the patronage of the Mysore government) for the founding of Mysore Soap Factory,
        Parasitoid Laboratory, Mysore Iron & Steel Works (now known as Viswesvarayya Iron and Steel Limited) in Bhadravathi, Sri Jayachamarajendra Polytechnic Bangalore,
        Bangalore Agricultural University, the State Bank of Mysore, Century Club, Mysore Chamber of Commerce (Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce & Industry),
        the Apex Chamber of Commerce in Karnataka, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (Bangalore) and numerous other industrial ventures. He encouraged private
        investment in industry during his tenure as Diwan of Mysore. He was instrumental in charting out a plan for road construction between Tirumala and Tirupati.
        [12][13] He was known for his sincerity, time management and dedication to his cause. The Bangalore Press and the Bank of Mysore were established during his tenure.
        A very important part of his nature was his love for Kannada. He set up Kannada Parishat for the improvement of Kannada. He wanted seminars for Kannada supporters
        to be instituted and conducted in Kannada itself.[14] Visvesvaraya is known to have designed and planned an entire area of Jayanagar in South Bangalore. The foundation
        of Jayanagar was laid in 1959. It was one of the first planned neighbourhoods in Bangalore and, at the time, the largest in Asia. It is believed that the locality,
        designed by Visvesvaraya, has one of best-planned layouts in Asia.
